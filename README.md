# End-to-End-Data-Engineering-with-Netflix-Use-Cases

This project demonstrates the implementation of an end-to-end data engineering pipeline, inspired by Netflix use cases, built using modern data engineering practices. 
The pipeline covers the entire data lifecycle, from data ingestion and transformation to storage and analytics, aimed at handling large-scale datasets typical in the 
streaming industry.

Key steps of the project include:

Data Ingestion: The project begins with the collection of raw data, simulating the types of information Netflix would use, such as user interactions, movie metadata, and 
viewing histories. Data is ingested from various sources and made available for processing.

Data Transformation: Using industry-standard frameworks like Apache Spark and PySpark, the data is transformed into the desired format. Complex operations like data cleaning,
enrichment, and aggregation are performed to ensure the data is ready for analysis and reporting.

Data Storage: The transformed data is stored efficiently using scalable storage solutions, enabling fast retrieval and easy access for analysis. The project uses cloud-based 
data lakes, ensuring the system can scale seamlessly as data volume grows.

Data Analytics and Insights: The pipeline includes data processing workflows for real-time analytics and batch processing, where key Netflix use cases such as personalized 
recommendations, viewing patterns, and content popularity are analyzed.

ETL Automation: Automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes are built to move data through various stages of the pipeline. These workflows ensure consistency and accuracy,
allowing Netflix-style data operations to run smoothly and efficiently.

Scalability and Performance: The project focuses on scalability, ensuring the system can handle large datasets typical in the streaming industry, while maintaining high performance
for real-time data processing.
